# GG-HangMan

PLAY IT HERE: https://mish-a14.github.io/GG-HangMan/

Name of Game: Contemporary HangMan

Introduction: 

This is my first project and it is a functional browser Game inspired by the concept of HangMan. 
The theme of this game is inspired by Gossip Girl (tv drama series) and the concept is for players to guess the name of the main character from the show. The images are blurred and are revealed once the player has guessed the name. Each round is 30 seconds long! 


The project is created using the following: 

Vanilla Javascript 
HTML5 
CSS3


Rules of the game: 

Just have fun and test your Gossip girl trivia knowledge by guessing the name of a character from the show which is a blurred image within a 30 second window !

Future Enhancements: 
I would like to work on and add on the “lives” function to my game so that when someone clicks a wrong letter on my keyboard; they lose a life 
I also need to work on the CSS to improve the User Experience for my game, since I mostly focused on creating the logic behind it.
